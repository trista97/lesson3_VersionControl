            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is very important to all industries, but perhaps most important to the technology industry. When multiple programmers are collaborating and working on the same project, they require a way to make and save new changes to said project and share them with others. In addition, they also need a safety net, in this case, an original unaltered version of the project in case something goes wrong.  This is where version control systems come in handy. A VCS is a system that records changes to files over time and allows you to revert back to various versions at any time. These systems allow you to monitor and see who made changes to projects and files over time as well. These features make version control essential in case something goes wrong with a file.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When choosing a version control system it is important to note the differences in the locations of different version control systems and repositories. Local repositories are stored on the end-users computer/machine and allows the user to copy files into another directory. This is not the most effective VCS because it is easy to write over files if you forget which directory you’re in. Remote repositories are considered distributed version control systems and allow clients to fully mirror the repository when fetching files, rather than only receiving snapshots of these files. Remote repositories are stored on a server computer and allow users to access the repository locally. I will be using the Github DVCS for my projects in this class because it allows for collaboration with different groups of people and several remote repositories.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Basics</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is one of the most unique VCS because of the way it thinks about data. Git stores data as though it is a set of snapshots of a miniature file system, rather than just storing the file again. If files have not changed, Git just stores a link to the previous identical file it has already used. With Git, nearly every operation is local even though it is a remote repository. Git finds your history in your local database and allows you to view your history instantly. Since so much is done locally, this means you can make, edit and commit changes when you are not connected to Git, and it will save to your local database. When you return to the network, you can then push your files to the Git directory. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Some of the most important commands in Git include, $ git status, $ git add, $ git checkout, and $ git push. git status allows you to determine where your file is in the cycle, either untracked, unmodified, modified or staged. In order to begin tracking a new file, you must use $ git add, which begins tracking the file and stages the file to be committed. If you need to switch between branches you use $ git checkout “insert name of branch/commit here.” You then run $ git commit to get the branch or file. Finally, there is $ git push, which finds and commits the file on your local branch to the remote repository. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Uses of Various Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems, while they come in many forms, from local, to central and distributed, are essential to teams that collaborate. While local version control systems are not the best option, they provide a quick and easy way to store multiple versions of files and recreate the file from any point and time. When collaborating with developers of other systems, a central version control system is a great option that can push files to a version database / central file server. Finally, there are distributed version control systems that provide the most diverse and perhaps effective option for collaborating on projects because they are fast, non-dependent on a server (which can be a single point of failure), and allow users to commit locally before committing remotely.</p>
